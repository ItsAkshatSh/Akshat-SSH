excerpt: My experience presenting Hisabi at Genius Hour and why it was unforgettable.
---

Today’s **Genius Hour** was honestly one of the best experiences I’ve had in a while.

It was fun, challenging, and super rewarding all at once, but lowkey it's sad that it isn't a comp bruh

## What I Presented

I presented my project [**Hisabi**](https://github.com/ItsAkshatSh/hisabipocket) – my AI-powered finance companion app  
Walking the judges through:
- Receipt scanning
- Speech-to-text expense logging
- AI spending insights
- Weekly Wrapped features

Seeing people actually *understand* and appreciate what I built felt unreal

it kirkenuily was pretty nice to see people appreciate and i couldn't do this without my hb Briyan, he ***carried*** the UI, while I did the features, it was fun but draining asw, so i honestly don't know if i will be doing this again in the future

Thanks for reading!

---

I’ve been working on something pretty exciting lately – an AI-powered finance tracking app called **Hisabi** 
The goal? To make managing money *way less annoying* and actually fun to use.

Let me walk you through what it does and why I built it.

## Why Hisabi?

Let’s be real, most people:
- Don’t have time to track expenses
- Forget to log transactions
- Find finance apps boring or complicated

Hisabi is made for people who want control over their spending **without doing extra work**.  
You spend, Hisabi handles the rest 

## Core Features

### Receipt Reading
Just snap a photo of your receipt and Hisabi reads it, extracts the amount, store name, and category automatically.

No more typing numbers manually like it’s 2005.

###  Speech to Text
Bought something and feeling lazy?  
Just say it:

> "Spent 120 on groceries"

Hisabi converts your voice into an expense entry instantly.  
Fast. Clean. No friction.

### AI Spending Insights
This is where things get smart.

Hisabi uses AI to:
- Analyze your spending habits
- Show where your money actually goes
- Suggest ways to save

Example:
> "You spent 30% more on food this week compared to last week"

It’s like having a financial buddy in your pocket.

## Implemented Features

All of this is already live:

- Weekly Wrapped (your spending recap every week)
- Smart categories
- Cloud sync
- AI driven

## what's coming next?

not completely sure, but surely something related to reading you spendings on a card, by reading the sms noti's

## Who Is It For?

Hisabi is perfect for:
- Busy students
- Working professionals
- Anyone who hates spreadsheets
- People who *want to save* but don’t know where to start

Basically – if money tracking feels tedious, Hisabi is for you.
